# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-
This project implements a Heart Disease Prediction system using Logistic Regression in Python. The model predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on clinical parameters such as age, cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate, and more.

📌 Project Highlights

Performed data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas and NumPy

Analyzed dataset structure, statistics, and class distribution

Split data into training and testing sets using stratified sampling

Built and trained a Logistic Regression model using Scikit-learn

Achieved:

Training Accuracy: ~85.5%

Testing Accuracy: ~80.3%

Developed a predictive system that takes real user input and predicts heart disease presence

🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset

303 records with 13 medical features

Binary classification:

1 → Heart Disease

0 → No Heart Disease

🚀 Use Case

This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in the early detection of heart disease, helping healthcare professionals and learners understand real-world ML applications.
